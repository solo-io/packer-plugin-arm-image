    The `arm-image` Packer builder plugin is able to re-master arm/aarch64 images on x86 machines
    using qemu-user-static. The builder can download a source image, runs any provisioning necessary
    on the image including binary invocations like "apt-get".

# Arm Image Builder

Type: ``
Artifact BuilderId: `yuval-k.arm-image`

The `arm-image` Packer builder plugin is able re-master image files to automate their creation.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters.

In addition to the options listed here,
a [communicator](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this builder.

### Required:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.

### Optional:

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ISOConfig struct in multistep/commonsteps/iso_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `iso_urls` ([]string) - Multiple URLs for the ISO to download. Packer will try these in order.
  If anything goes wrong attempting to download or while downloading a
  single URL, it will move on to the next. All URLs must point to the same
  file (same checksum). By default this is empty and `iso_url` is used.
  Only one of `iso_url` or `iso_urls` can be specified.

- `iso_target_path` (string) - The path where the iso should be saved after download. By default will
  go in the packer cache, with a hash of the original filename and
  checksum as its name.

- `iso_target_extension` (string) - The extension of the iso file after download. This defaults to `iso`.

<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in pkg/builder/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command_wrapper` (string) - Lets you prefix all builder commands, such as with ssh for a remote build host. Defaults to "".
  Copied from other builders :)

- `output_directory` (string) - Output directory, where the final image will be stored.
  Deprecated - Use OutputFile instead

- `output_filename` (string) - Output filename, where the final image will be stored

- `image_type` (utils.KnownImageType) - Image type. this is used to deduce other settings like image mounts and qemu args.
  If not provided, we will try to deduce it from the image url. (see autoDetectType())
  For list of valid values, see: pkg/image/utils/images.go

- `image_mounts` ([]string) - Where to mounts the image partitions in the chroot.
  first entry is the mount point of the first partition. etc..

- `mount_path` (string) - The path where the volume will be mounted. This is where the chroot environment will be.
  Will be a temporary directory if left unspecified.

- `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - What directories mount from the host to the chroot.
  leave it empty for reasonable defaults.
  array of triplets: [type, device, mntpoint].

- `additional_chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - What directories mount from the host to the chroot, in addition to the default ones.
  Use this instead of `chroot_mounts` if you want to add to the existing defaults instead of
  overriding them
  array of triplets: [type, device, mntpoint].
  for example: `["bind", "/run/systemd", "/run/systemd"]`

- `resolv-conf` (ResolvConfBehavior) - Can be one of: off, copy-host, bind-host, delete. Defaults to off

- `last_partition_extra_size` (uint64) - Should the last partition be extended? this only works for the last partition in the
  dos partition table, and ext filesystem

- `target_image_size` (uint64) - The target size of the final image. The last partition will be extended to
  fill up this much room. I.e. if the generated image is 256MB and TargetImageSize
  is set to 384MB the last partition will be extended with an additional 128MB.

- `qemu_binary` (string) - Qemu binary to use. default is qemu-arm-static
  If this is an absolute path, it will be used. Otherwise, we will look for one in your PATH
  and finally, try to auto fetch one from https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static/

- `disable_embedded` (bool) - Do not use embedded qemu.

- `qemu_args` ([]string) - Arguments to qemu binary. default depends on the image type. see init() function above.
